# Leetcode Solutions
## What is this?
I started using Leetcode to stay sharp on my algorithms, and also just have a
bit of fun. People have fun doing sudoku, I can have fun doing coding problems,
okay?! I quickly abandoned the web client when I learned about
[leetcode-cli](https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli). I can do all this in
the command line now? What joy! Since I'm in the command line, might as well
make it a repo to track my changes. After all, if I write code and it doesn't
show up on my contribution chart, does it even count?

## Don't cheat yourself!
If for some reason you have stumbled across my humble repository while looking
for some answers to Leetcode, please try to solve the problem yourself first.
Also, how many pages deep into a google search were you? There are myriad sites
that will help you with this stuff better than my solutions will. Please use
those. Carry on!
